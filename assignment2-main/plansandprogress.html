<title2>Plans and Progress</title2>
<title2>Basic project overview</title2>
<p>The Project is an Augmented Reality Poker game played on iOS or Android. Using a smart phone screen and camera the game can generate digital objects such as cards and poker chips. The player will use hand gestures to signal moves in poker that will be registered buy the app. The standard rules of poker apply but everything is digital.  </p>
<title2>Project story  </title2>
<p>The project started as a concept created by Jarrod Nguyen in assignment 1 of introduction to information technology through RMIT as a collection of tabletop games played in augmented reality. The project idea really started to develop as multiple members of Team Vision Smiths built upon it in assignment 2 were the team decided upon the first AR tabletop game they would make, VR poker. In assignment 3 the team decided their sole focus would be on AR poker. During assignment 3 was when team vision smith really started creating headway on their project. Team vision smith started by designing what the game would look like through Figma and then set about developing it through Unity using C# for code and photo shop for basic art and graphic design.  </p>

<title2>How will the project be made?  </title2>
<p>The project layout and concepts will be designed using Figma. Using the designs on Figma team Vision Smiths will then design as much of the game as they can using Unity, C#, and Photoshop. </p>

<title2>Figma Progress </title2>
<p>Figma has been used to make a visual representation of what the finished project might look like before Team Vision Smiths starts trying to create it. Using Figma Team Vision Smiths has laid out a plan that incorporates everything from a loading screen to game play.  In Figma conceptual images have been created that show the entirety of what the game might be. </p>

<title2>APP design and what’s on Figma </title2>
<title2>Logos and Icons Figma </title2>
<p>The game will have a basic app cion of a poker chip that says “pokAR” in the middle of it for the app store and home screen. The games load screen will display a still image of team vision Smiths logo. </p>
<title2>Login screens and menus in Figma </title2>
<p>After the game loads in the user will be greeted with a screen that gives them the option to play as a guest or sign in. If a user chooses to sign in, they will be greeted with a login screen to enter their ID and password or an option to sign up. After players login they will be located at the games main menu where they have the options to visit the applications store, Play, or go to options. If a player chose to play the game, they will be greeted with another menu that gives them options to invite other players or to choose what game type they would like to play, Ranked, Private or Custom.  </p>

<title2>Game play in Figma </title2>
<p>The game is played by the user holding their hand out in from of their phone and making distinct hand gestures the game can pick up on. The hand gestures are used to replace the actions used in poker for example holding your palm towards your device will show the cards you are using, putting your hand down flat will show you have folded and closing your hands with a thumbs up will call a bet.  </p>

<article class="">
<title2>Unity Progress </title2>
<p>Using unity some basic menus have been created and a mock-up of some basic AR features have been made and tested on a phone.
While using Unity, ran into a memory corruption error due to low system resources and had to wipe entire laptop.  Moved project on to gaming PC due to performance issues.
Making progress on getting menus to appear in AR and almost touch screen placing into the world. </p>

<title2>Photoshop Progress </title2>
<p>Photo shop has been used to make some basic art for menus and basic Figma game concepts. </p>
<title2>C# Progress </title2>
<p>C# has been used to write basic code to control the unity game engine.  </p>
<title2>GitHub Progress </title2>
<p>The unity progress has been backed up and shared through GitHub  </p>
<title2>Changes  </title2>
<p>The main change in the project has been the focus point of team vision smith from a library of AR games to a single AR poker game. The change came about because an entire library of games would be extremely hard to plan and create in a limited time frame especially with team Vision Smiths having no experience in AR development.</p>
<title2>Notes for project hand over </title2>
<p>The Project is in a verry early stage of development with no complete playable game. All the concepts and ideas are there with clear visual representations of what the project will be. Most of the core functions in the game will need to be developed. The project is complex and needs experienced developers who understand Unity and C# with experience in AR development. </p>
