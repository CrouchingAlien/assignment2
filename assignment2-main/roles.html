        Roles

    Vision Smiths has not formally given any members of the group specific rolls as the workload is typically dispersed into individual tasks. Giving tasks allows the group to spread the workload efficiently and more fairly. As time has gone on from the start off assignment 2 through to assignment 3 some members have been taking on rolls or could be classified as being a certain roll, but nothing has been made official.

    If Vision smith was to use rolls and titles to describe the group members it probably has Jessica as project manager because she typically organizes the team meetings and delegates tasks, Jarrod would be lead Developer because he came up with most of the project idea, Kolby and Derek would software developers because they work on the development of the project, Cameron as the web developer or social media manager because he has contributed the most to the team’s website design and coding. <p/><p>As the group continues to work together, roles might become more defined and official but right now the Vision Smith team tries to work together on all tasks and doesn’t see a need for any official titles. Having the entire team work on all aspects of the project allows all members the chance to learn everything involved with the project.
