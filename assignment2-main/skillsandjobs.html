      <title2><b>IT Work</b></title2>

      <p>
        Work within the IT industry is very broad and encapsulates a wide variety of positions of different specialisations.
        Demands in skills are constantly evolving over time, making it difficult to grasp the work that is expected of individuals within the IT industry (Clapp 2021).
        Vision Smith’s had the opportunity to talk to Derek Van Tonder, a representative of the Australian technology company Euclideon Holographics,
        the “world leader in Holograms,” (Euclideon Holographics 2022) in hopes to gain a deeper understanding of life within the IT industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        Cameron Jackson: Can you give us a brief overview of what Euclideon Holographics is and the products you have developed?
        <br><br>
        Derek Van Tonder: Euclideon Holographics manufactures hologram systems in Australia.
        So, by hologram systems, we mean a room that you step into, you wear some small glasses that track your eye,
        and you see objects that float in the air in front of you …
        So very much like virtual reality, except you don’t have to wear a big helmet on your head.
        That’s our competitive differentiating point.
        It’s a social technology, so that means you can have multiple people in the same room, unlike virtual reality, where nobody can see anybody else …
        then you’re losing a lot of that social important stuff like being able to make eye contact. Our systems don’t have that problem …
        They’re most commonly used as a training tool or as a sales tool. So that’s a very quick rundown on what we do.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        C.J.: Other than the social aspects of being able to see each other across the hologram, what other inspirations are there behind the products?
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: The whole reason we built our company … was to solve the problem of virtual reality …
        just having a big helmet on your head and screens in front of your eyes automatically stops a whole bunch of important social things happening.
        For example, one of our clients is Airbus. They sell very expensive satellite systems to people using our hologram table.
        Now that would be a lot harder to do if they had to put helmets on everyone’s heads … but they love using our hologram table,
        because they can have a much more social experience.
        It’s much warmer, and they can achieve their sales goal much more easily by that.
        <br><br>
        Derek Geerin: I like that, because it can be working in a salesroom environment for salespeople as well.
        <br><br>
        D.V.T: Exactly, so it’s very popular for sales. It’s also very popular for training.
        So, our hologram room allows you to have multiple people in the same room doing training …
        That’s a lot easier if you can actually make eye contact and have that coaching …
        You can talk to the instructors, they can point things out, it’s just a lot more natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        D.G.: So, can you give a description of how the product actually works?
        The processes involved. Sort of like the background details on what allows users to see and interact with the holograms.
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: Sure, so really you have to start with the content first … We have a number of different systems ...
        We have the table, which is designed for smaller models like building models ...
        It’s basically a replacement for a flat map or a one of those little cardboard models that architects like to use …
        Then you have the hologram room, which is totally different.
        It’s a massive five metre by five metre room. We can have multiple people totally immersed in a real 3D model.
        So, each of those requires different kinds of content. So, for the hologram room, we offer basically two versions of our software.
        One is just a simple piece of software that lets you load static models that are not animated.
        So, you can have some basic interaction like press a button to view first floor, second floor, but you can’t do much more than that ...
        It’s enough for an architect who just wants to show someone how it looks when you look out the window of your new building before it’s built.
        <br><br>
        Then we’re partnering with Epic … They’re doing a massive new project in the metaverse. So, we’re working with them to bring Unreal Engine to our systems and that allows you to build pretty much any hologram that you want, up to photo realistic detail if you like.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        D.G.: That actually sounds really good. It got me thinking like, what’s going on with meta and social media and things?
        So, what are your plans for the future? What are you hoping the product will achieve and what’s the main selling point to appeal to the target audience?
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: So, our primary European Union distributor …
        They’ve been at the CES show in Las Vegas last week and they were showing everyone how the metaverse is going to link up with systems.
        Basically …  we’re going to be the front end for the metaverse … Our solution is a lot more natural and that’s what they were pushing at CES ...
        So, Facebook would make the software … and we would make the hardware so that you consume their software or look at it from a different perspective, if that makes sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        Jarrod Nguyen: Could you talk about some of like, your biggest hurdles you’ve faced when developing your products?
        <br><br>
        D.V.T: The biggest hurdle for us, I think, is just inventing new things, because we make everything ourselves …
        We’re actually building everything ourselves from scratch.
        So, we had to go out and find people who can build really detailed circuits and chips and things.
        It’s almost easier to say what was not challenging than what is challenging like every part of that process was very difficult.
        You need the top people in the industry, you need people that are genius level to work on it.
        Staffing is a big challenge, finding components at the moment is difficult ... So those are two big challenges we face.
        <br><br>
        Another challenge obviously in the age of Covid is that we actually have to send a technician to install the system, because they’re complex …
        It’s a hologram system, so they’re quite tricky to calibrate. You need to be trained …
        we’ve actually had to cancel many orders recently in the last year or two due to … not being able to send people overseas …
        So, in order to fix that, we’re actually raising capital at the moment to build showrooms in the United States
        that will have technicians attached to them. U.S. employers who can then go out and service that market for us
        without us having to fly out from Australia every time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        J.N.: So, going a bit more personal, can I ask what your role specifically in the company is?
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: It’s not a gigantic multi-national corporation. The roles are very fluid in our company …
        My official job title is investors relation manager. So, it’s my job to keep the investors happy basically.
        Largely that entails just keeping them informed, arranging meetings with them.
        Sometimes they come tour our facilities, that I have to go and just be nice to them, and explain what are we up to in the business …
        Our CEO doesn’t really have time, because we now have many investors …
        So, he gets me to do it and it’s a very important role in the business, because often our investors are also partnering with us in different ways.
        Like a lot of our big shareholders actually distribute our products as well.
        So that’s a very important role, keeping everyone up to date.
        I also train those distributors. So, we run quite intensive sessions …
        to help them understand how to sell our technology, which is quite a tricky process. You have to really understand it.
        <br><br>
        The other role I have also is fundraising. So, whenever a new investor pops up, a potential investor pops up, and says
        “Hey, I’m interested investing in your technology company, what are you all about?” Then I brief them, I give them a presentation in person if I can.
        I demonstrate all the technology to them and then we talk turkey with them basically and say,
        “Look, this is the share price, this is the evaluation, this is where we think we’re going to be in 2 years, this is our ideal plan etc.”
        and then I help them to make that decision as well. So, it’s a very multi-faceted role.
        <br><br>
        I actually have a background as a software developer ... So that really helps because I can talk with authenticity about all of the different systems,
        having actually developed some of them … it’s a role where I wear many hats, because it’s not a gigantic company, often the CEO will just step in and say,
        “Hey, can you make a video about this?” or, “Hey, I need to train these guys,” or, “Hey, I’ve got an investor, can you do a demo for them?”
        But … I’m quite happy with that, because it keeps it interesting. I’m not just staring at spreadsheets all day.
        <br><br>
        D.G.: Yeah, I hear you about the spreadsheets.
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: I think in a lot of companies, the bigger the company, the more specialised your role tends to be …
        I find that super boring. I have worked for some large companies … they just bored the pants off me.
        I actually much prefer working at start-ups and smaller companies where things are a bit more interesting.
        Where you can really make a difference. Although it’s harder work, it’s more interesting and entertaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        Kolby Hunt: Given what your role entails, where do you spend most of your time?
        Like on what tasks? You said you were pretty flat out everywhere.
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: Two years ago, I would’ve said I spent most of my time doing demonstrations, and bringing people in and talking to them,
        and having meetings, and we would go to conferences all the time, and exhibitions.
        We travelled around the world …  Running stands, things like that.
        <br><br>
        But after Covid, that all changed. Now I spend most of my day just on Zoom calls … to various investors …
        or potential investors who I need to brief, and that can be a very arduous process.
        If someone’s investing hundreds and thousands of dollars with you, they want to do very detailed due diligence.
        They want to make very sure that you’re a good company … meet everyone on the team ... So that’s what I generally spend most of the time doing.
        It’s just interacting with people outside company … Managing that and taking off my CEOs hands so that he can actually run the place.
        That would probably be the best way I could describe it.
        <br><br>
        Also training our distributors. Because I’m one of the longest serving people, I know the systems the best.
        They often bring on board new people and then I sit down, and I train them, and that’s a big commitment from them.
        That’s 20 hours of Zoom calls, plus an assessment that I do with them and then we do the role plays … the whole point of it is that I’m coaching them.
        You have to do quite a bit of that to sort of skill them … It depends, every given month it’s a bit different.
        Some months I spend the whole time on Zoom, talking to one investor. Other months it’s just lots of bits and pieces.
        It varies. Very very fluid.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        K.H.: What would be the most challenging thing you do in your work?
        What would that be, talking to investors or?
        <br><br>
        D.V.T.: I wouldn’t say I have anything that are super difficult in my job.
        Probably just investors sometimes saying, “Where’s my dividends?” “Where’s my money?” “I want to pull my money out right now,”
        and then we have to … deal with that because we’re still a private company …
        Then we have to bring the CEO on, and we have a little meeting with them and say,
        “Look we’re still RND phase. We’re not publicly listed yet. You do have to wait a little longer.
        The money is safe, we’re still cracking away. Just wait a little bit longer.”
        Those are always very delicate … The board has given us a directive. It’s still a private company.
        We can’t do that. It’s not a common thing, it’s rare, it’s unusual. It’s only happened a couple of times.
        <br><br>
        Other than that, it’s a sales role … You have to do a certain number of calls per day.
        That’s the measure of success for me … If I’ve done more than 2 or 3,
        I’m doing well and then I know that in the long run I will have a good result for the company …
        my CEO amusingly, he literally said … “I need to run the company as well and I can’t do that if
        I’m in a talking with investor number 775 all day long.” … This is how it works as most companies grow.
        You need to start delegating things in a smart way. That’s probably the hardest thing I do.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I would say the job is pretty straight forward.
        Once you have your scripts and your templates and things in place that you can just read off them,
        it becomes a lot easier and smoother.
      </p>

        Van Tonder later goes into a little more depth on the company’s current strategy to market their product,
        and potential future audiences they may expand into. He also talks about his little side project alongside his day job.
        A Tik Tok-esque app that combines the navigation style of Tik Tok with books.
        He mentions a few of his motivating factors to create the app, as well as further challenges he faced in the development process.
        The link to the full interview can be found in the appendix.
