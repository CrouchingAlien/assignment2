      Blockchain and Cryptocurreny
    </h1>
      
      <p>
        A block chain is what powers all crypto currencies including Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Simply a block chain is made up of blocks, and each block contains data about new transactions on it (Codecademy News, 2021). Crypto currency’s use block-chain technology for two main reasons, security, and decentralisation. The security of the block chain comes from an operation known as hashing in which all the data on a block is put through a mathematical formula that gives each block its own unique id/code that acts almost like a fingerprint(Simply Explained - Savjee, 2017). Crypto currencies use public ledgers to store and manage the data of blockchains. The public ledger makes it so one person or organisation can’t make changes to the block-chain because everyone else has a copy of the blockchain (Simply Explained - Savjee, 2017). Using block chain technology allows for the decentralisation of currency without, banks, financial institutions or any sort of middleman getting involved.

<h3>Uses of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>
  Cryptocurrencies are used the same way money is used, for trading of goods and services. Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies people mostly use it as a speculative long-term investment (ASIC, n.d.). Cryptocurrency can also be used in illicit activity mainly black-market transactions and scams, due to features that can help keep the users anonymous (ASIC, n.d.). Even though cryptocurrencies only really allow for trading and long-term speculative investing options the new innovations in blockchain technology and the combination of new blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies allow for an almost endless range of features. Some recent block chain technologies utilisations are the use of NFT’s, smart contracts and defi. A NFT also known as none-fungible token is unique token that cannot be interchanged with other NFT’s as it has its own unique value (Clark, 2021). Using NFT’s allows people to own digital assets and allows them to buy and sell them using crypto currencies (Clark, 2021). Smart contracts are programmes that are stored on the blockchain allowing them to make pre-determined, unalterable, automated, decentralized decisions without the need of a middleman (Frankenfield, 2021). Smart contracts are typically used for financial agreements such as over collateralized loans (Frankenfield, 2021). Defi stands for decentralized finance defi is basically the entire financial system but decentralised using blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Defi allows for a permissionless financial system where users don’t need banks or governments permission to participate in the financial system and they can participate how they want legally or illegally (Sharma, 2021).

<h3>
  New features of blockchain and cryptocurrencies
</h3>
<p>
  New and emerging technologies in the crypto market are coming in the form of defi. Defi Is allowing for a freer market approach to economics and it is stepping straight over governments and financial institutions to get there. The creations of new smart contracts that allow people to loan and lend money in larger amounts with less collateral is something that will hopefully come into effect soon. NFT’s may start to become more than just a representation of a digital asset and become a representation of something in the real world. NFTs might be used in the near or far future to represent the deed to a house allowing smart contracts to be written that use a person’s home as collateral for their loan without any third-party involvement (Waterworth, 2021). The opportunities defi can offer are only limited by the integration of the digital world into the real world.
</p>
<h3>
  Likely Impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies
</h3>
<p>
  As Defi continues to develop and the adoption of cryptocurrency increases countries with poor economy’s due to corrupt and incompetent governments will most likely be the first adopters. The use of crypto currencies will give poor countries access to finances that their government has no control over, hopefully freeing up the economy and promoting economic growth. Using cryptocurrencies to avoid government regulations means the users may no longer be protected by the laws in their country, and this opens them up to scams and hacks something that will become more prevalent as this technology is adopted (ASIC, n.d.). Smart contracts will take over the way financial investments are protected. Smart contracts will be written, and they will execute pre-determined agreements of borrowers and private lenders removing the services banks provide almost completely. Replacing lenders that work at banks for these automated smart contracts will leave many people in the financial sector displaced and out of work. Countries around the world will start outlawing or incorporating centralised versions of these technologies to keep control over their economies but this will not stop the use of decentralized alternatives. Black market trade of illegal products and services will completely adopt the use of decentralized blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. Criminals are already using crypto currency to make illegal transactions, and this will only increase as time goes on and alternative ways become less common such as cash (Schlesinger, 2021). Blockchain and cryptocurrency technology seem to be a definite part of the future but only time will tell if the technologies give people more freedoms and control over their finances or if they will give criminals more tools for their illicit activities.

<h3>
  How blockchain and cryptocurrencies will affect me 
</h3>
<p>
  The effect of blockchain and cryptocurrency will change the way I buy goods and services and the way I invest my money. When paying for goods and services I will find myself using a form of crypto currency with a card that holds crypto instead of one that holds the AUD.  All the money I would previously hold in my bank will be crypto instead of cash. When getting a loan for something like a car or a house I will instead look for options online that are offered through smart contracts. My investments will continue to be in the crypto space but instead of investing my money into cryptocurrencies growing in value my investments will be in Defi and lending through smart contracts. The real difference will be my assets won’t be looked after by a bank or financial organisations instead I will hold them in a crypto wallet. All of this will provide me with many freedoms I otherwise would not have when it came to my finances, but it also will come with risk. Investing and being responsible for my finances will make me vulnerable to scammers and hackers especially if I am not educated enough on how to look after my money. My friends and family similar age or younger will most likely adopt this technology but others who are older might be reluctant and suspicious of it.
