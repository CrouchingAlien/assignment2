      <p>Having been already formed it made it a lot easier to have tasks delegated. Also, having a group leader and specific roles and tasks made the assessment flow significantly better than the previous one.  Other key factors that went well throughout include; communication between members, understanding of the tasks required by each person and individuals doing things that needed to be done without delegation.<br><br>

I was surprised at how well the members who used AR development applications progressed throughout such a short time period. Their knowledge of the applications grew incredibly quickly and it shows how much they achieved in this project. Another key surprising moment was how fluidly the entire project came together as everyone was motivated and involved with their individual and group tasks.<br><br>

Having followed along learning from other members that had been checking out the app development side and gotten some ideas of how some of the IOS and Android app developments work, I have learned a great deal in regards to the processes that go on. During this project it was also interesting to learn more thoroughly about all the different people that would be involved in the development teams with an it company.</p>
