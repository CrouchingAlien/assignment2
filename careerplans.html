  <p>After comparing some basic tabulated data across each of the team ideal jobs it becomes apparent that the majority of the jobs are very similar and require similar skill sets (skills in significantly different areas of IT) with a fairly similar pay scale.  Still, each job comes with its own special requirements and skills that set it apart from the rest. </p>

<p>The main components that set Software developer jobs apart from the others are the minimal initial level of education. Having a sound knowledge of programming languages and experience can be all that is required for some positions; a more competitive applicant will have a degree aligning with the job requirements though.  The biggest difference between a software engineer and developer is that the developer deals with design and program implementation. </p>

<p>Game developers typically make less money than the other jobs that have been mentioned in the tabulated data. The major difference is that a game developer will need to extensively look into the hardware that the game needs to run, for example, Ram, CPU-GPU etc. when developing their games where as the majority of other jobs that have been mentioned only tend to need to think about ram and a basic internet connection. </p>

<p>Senior software engineers are required to have a higher level of technical skill than the other jobs that were mentioned above. Whilst it is often easier for a software engineer to work as a software developer the reverse is not so true. <p>There is a clear skill gap required between the role of a software engineer and software developer as well as a small salary difference. The salary difference doesnâ€™t appear to correlate with the different requirements for each of the jobs. </p>

<p>The key difference between an android developer and other software or games developers is that they make software specific to the android operating systems. Other than the different operating system android developers often require the use of programs and software that other developers would not use, an example being Android Studio. An android developers salary is similar to a game developers in how varied it can be across the different positions within those fields. </p>


<p>In conclusion, all the different jobs that have been discussed come with their own benefits and drawbacks. Each with different salaries and each with individual skills and proficiencies required. The jobs show the varied ideals of the group and the various goals that each member will need to focus on reaching prior to their commencement in their individual ideal jobs in the different fields of IT. </p>
