    <title2> About Our Career Plans </title2>

  <p>The most common element in each of our career plans is that we all require this course to start them. Other common factors include either joining a team or finding a job that can help further us within the world of IT. We each have an idea for a passion project and an end goal we would each like to achieve to make our projects a reality.
  </p>
<p>The groupâ€™s ideal career goals differ from wanting to run a game design company, becoming an app developer working on projects that inspire passion or creating a mobile applications development business. While immediately the individual career plans may seem similar, they all have their own end state, which is vastly different.
</p>
<p>The similarities between career plans across the group are few compared to the number of differences they have. The different personalities within the group inspire different goals and can be easily seen in the end goals of every member's career plan
