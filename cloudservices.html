      <title2>Cloud Services</title2>

        <p><h3>WHAT IS THE CLOUD?</h3></p> 

<p>The cloud is the group of servers that you are able access over the internet and the software that is installed on those servers.</p> 

<p>The cloud servers are in places called data centres. These data centres, found all over the world, typically host thousands of servers.</p>  

<p>Companies and even private users can access the cloud for all sorts of things.<\p> 

<p>Many companies generally prefer to use cloud storage for their data as it cuts back on maintenance and utility costs.  This can also save them money on hiring their own IT engineers as the data centres have specialised people who run and maintain the servers.</p> 

<p>The point of the cloud is it allows users to access the same files and applications from almost any device because the processing and data is stored on a server instead of a user’s physical device. </p>

<p>Think of your own personal computer.  It will have a hard drive which you use as storage. Now when you save your data, it is saved to the physical hard drive.</p> 

<p>But what if you need to access that data from say a work, school computer, your mobile phone or any other computer in the world?  The answer is unless you have a portable hard drive which also has that same data stored, you can’t. </p>

<p>That’s where the cloud comes in, instead of saving that data to a local hard drive or portable hard drive, it is saved on servers permanently connected to the internet and is accessible from almost any device (depending on file type) from anywhere in the world.</p> 

<p>The cloud has other uses apart from just storage, but we will get to those later.</p> 

  <p>CLOUD SECURITY</p>

<p>Access to these data centres both digitally and physically is very secure, from security and electronic pass, boom-gate technology at the entrance to iris and biometric scanners in the lobby.</p> 

<p>The data centres are very restrictive to who they allow inside with only a very small force of workers able to have access to even the lobby and that’s just the physical security. </p>

<p>While it is never possible to prevent every type of attack, A well designed security strategy can greatly reduce the risks of most cyber-attacks.</p> 

<p>Even with the risks associated with using the cloud, in most cases cloud security is a lot more secure then in house servers as cloud providers have more resources for keeping data secure then most businesses, thus being able to update and secure any vulnerabilities as soon as they arise. </p>

  <p>KEY CLOUD SECURITY TECHNOLOGY</p> 

<p>Encryption: Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information </p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM): IAM products track who a user is and what they are allowed to do. They are also responsible for approving and denying access as necessary. </p>

<p>Firewall: Unlike standard firewalls on a personal computer, Cloud firewalls provide a layer of protection around cloud assets by blocking malicious web traffic. </p> 

<p>DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES</p>

<p>Software-as-a-service (SaaS) - SaaS means the application is hosted on the server and the user can access them over the internet.  Examples of SaaS is Google workspace, Dropbox, and Netflix. </p>

<p>Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) - PaaS is used for developing your own applications, PaaS hosts the tools, infrastructure, and operating systems you need to be able to develop your own applications.  Examples of PaaS is Windows Azure and Google App Engine. </p>

<p>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) – IaaS is for companies to rent the servers and storage required to be able to build their own applications.  Examples of IaaS is AWS (Amazon Web Services) </p>

<p>Function-as-a-service (FaaS) – FaaS is a relatively new cloud service which enables the user to break applications down into smaller parts and only use them when they are needed.  Example of FaaS is Google cloud functions. </p>

  <p>FUTURE OF CLOUD TECHNOLOGY: </p>

<p>Cloud technology is still in its infancy and as such many new services are being developed.  Most recently Cloud gaming. </p>

<p>While cloud gaming still requires an extremely fast internet speed, for those of us able to utilise this experimental technology it enables the user to play games over an internet connection without having to install the games thus reducing the need for storage space.  In other words, it’s like streaming but instead of movies and tv shows, its computer and console games.  Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass comes to mind and recently they have updated their hardware with the new Xbox Series X for all servers. </p>

<p>IMPACT OF CLOUD GAMING: </p>

<p>If you are a gamer already then you already know of the constant requirement to upgrade to the next generation gaming console or constantly upgrading the performance of your gaming computer such as Graphics card, RAM, processor, cooling unit and in extreme cases motherboards. </p>

<p>Maybe you play games but don’t know anything about hardware, so you instead choose to either buy a new computer and sell the old one or send it to a pc shop for them to upgrade your old machine.</p> 

<p>It can get extremely expensive continuously upgrading to new technology, Graphics cards and RAM are usually the most upgraded pieces of hardware. </p>  

<p>A simple google search for “best graphics card” comes up with the Nvidia QUADRO RTX A6000 48GB which retails for $7,899.  Now for most of us a card with that dollar value is way out of our price range so a serious game might instead opt for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 which although still quite pricey is much more reasonable at $1,499 and offers some good qualify gaming. </p>

<p>With Cloud gaming all that can be a thing of the past,  With cloud gaming the need to constantly upgrade your console or gaming computer is gone,  Instead with Gaming-as-a-Service (GaaS) you will be able to use the infrastructure at the data centres the gaming companies will run and as a result as long as you can install the application to run the games, you will be able to play high end games which require extremely powerful gaming machines to run on a lot less powerful machines without having to worry about low or poor quality and performance.</p> 

<p>What this will mean for consumers is that even the lower income earning families who have had to opt out of next gen gaming or must play games at much lower qualities to be able to run them smoothly will no longer have to sit on the sidelines and will also be able to enjoy gaming the way games are meant to be run.</p> 

<p>If they have a fast enough internet speed and let’s face it, Telstra offer 100 Mbs for $100 a month so it’s not overly expensive. </p>

<p>This is a huge benefit for me as I have a habit of buying things I want and not necessarily need which tends to bug my wife. </p>

<p>For instance, I wanted to try VR out, so I increased my ZIP Pay limit and bought an Oculus Quest VR Headset which I loved but it lacked the power to run certain games and the library was limited.</p> 

<p>I then bought a gaming pc with VR capability also the Oculus Rift S VR headset.  Did I need it?  No but I wanted it and my job could handle the repayments, so I thought, “What the hey?” </p>

<p>The reason I bring this up is with Cloud gaming, this will no longer be an issue.  Instead of me annoying my poor wife by buying these expensive upgrades (FYI I also have an Xbox Series S through Telstra subs, Series X is impossible to get) I can instead just sign up to a gaming subscription such as Xbox Game Pass or Google Stadia and play any games I want without having to buy the next gen console or upgrade my pc. </p>
