<title2>Cyber Security</title2>




<p>Cyber security in a nutshell is instrumental in defending computers, mobile phones, electronics, networks and data from malicious attacks by perpetrators. Cyber security can be broken down into a few different categories.
</p>
<p>Information security protects the privacy of data as it travels and during storage, network security secures a computer network from people who would attempt harm and from malicious malware. Operational security includes; permissions each user has on a network, the processing of and handling data assets. End-user education teaches people how to safely transfer files, download attachments and basically anything that a malicious actor would target your device through. Application security protects applications within the device from being compromised by threats and prevents actors from accessing information on your device through applications.
</p>

<p>So what exactly is cyber security? Cyber security is everywhere and almost every thing has it. Every website, phone, computer, computer server the list goes on, has some form of cyber security. The basic idea of cyber security would probably have one think about the links they click in emails or the videos they download. Its not so straightforward, even just when accessing websites having HTTPS instead of HTTP means that you will have an extra level of encryption between yourself and the website to protect your information.
</p>

<p>Other types of cyber security that the average user is likely to use are anti-malware, anti-virus and VPN’s. These forms of cyber security tend to focus on an everyday users protection. Anti-Malware and Anti-Virus software and protect your computer from intruders that might want to steal, sell or just poke around through your things. VPN’s act as a filter that hide your IP address and data by allowing it to be redirected through a remote server that secures all the information passed between the user and the websites visited.
</p>




<p>A cyber security analyst or information security analyst is a trained professional in information technology who monitors, prevents and stops cyber attacks from happening. Safeguarding organizations networks, install firewalls and monitoring activity across the network are all part of the job. The person is always essential to the job because malicious attacks and other nefarious computer hazards are ever changing and evolving, trying to get into sensitive information and data. This requires a person trained in defending, preventing and evolving defensive strategies against them.
</p>

<p>Some tools used by cyber security analysts include; threat analysis tools, pen testing, network intrusion detection software, antivirus software, web vulnerability tools and packet sniffers. These tools help protect networks by allowing cyber security analysts to find malicious software, practice infiltrating their own networks to check for vulnerabilities, find suspicious people connecting to their networks and scan web applications in order to check for vulnerabilities from the users side.
</p>

<p>Together Cyber security analysts work with these pieces of software and hardware in order to create a safe environment for users across the net. Coordination and a strong cyber security strategy can help organizations achieve the best possible outcomes in relation to their protection in the cyber world. The benefits include; protection for data networks, prevention of unauthorized access, protection for end users, and even an improved confidence from relevant parties involved with those organizations.
</p>

<p>As a whole cyber security provides layers of security which in turn prevent any sort of nefarious or malicious actions across the World Wide Web, as the cyber threats are constantly changing, adapting, learning and evolving so does the cyber security industry. With all this growth comes new ways to defeat the ever-looming threat that we all face and with these new success stories come more unique ways for threats to evolve as well. Without cyber security the Internet would be a wild west of information theft, ransom the list goes on.
</p>

<p>Over the next several years we will see a few specific changes to cyber security as a whole. As people are connecting more and more devices to the Internet televisions, refrigerators and many more it will be clear that an increase in focus on API security, cloud services/security and organizations focusing on application security will become apparent. Another huge impact to this space will be the hyper automation of software. As the speed of software development and hardware development increase, constantly bringing out updates to remain competitive we are likely to see organizations turn to machine learning and AI for tasks like identifying vulnerabilities and threat modeling.
</p>




<p>The likely impacts of theses changes will be an improvement in both cyber security as a whole and an improvement in the threats faced. The improvements being made in AI, autonomous machines and cloud services will make the cyber security space grow exponentially.  Cyber security analysts will be affected, they will have a different role when automation has a larger involvement in the day to days of the job. Having AI available for detection, prediction and response of cyber threats will make it simpler for the analyst to remove them as quickly as possible. Downsides to this technology are that the malicious actors can also use AI and autonomous machines to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>With cloud services becoming such a large part of the IOT (Internet of things), trusting a vendor of a cloud service with the protection of their networks instead of providing in house cyber security on a real mainframe is a hard step to take and might seem counter-productive. Now and in the future cyber security and cloud services will work far more closely than before, the two most common causes of data breaches in the cloud are misconfigured access restrictions and improperly secured systems, both of which are the responsibility of the organization and not the cloud services. This means the cyber security analyst will continue to provide in house security as well as make sure that smaller organizations that don’t understand or don’t have the available resources can still manage to provide the same security as larger organizations. </p>

<p>Over all, the potential impact of these developments in the cyber security space will change a cyber security analysts job and hopefully create a more secure internet of things for everyone connected. </p>



<p>These developments and improvements in the cyber security space will have significant changes on how user information is stored, how malicious attacks are prevented and how an individual user is affected. This will affect everyone using the IOT even if they are unaware of it. </p>

<p>Personally, it will be good to learn how these improvements and developments work in their individual areas as I am considering a career path that will be aligning parallel with cyber security. Cloud services will affect how a lot of my personal information is stored and the security of my personal information is paramount to me. My family and some of my friends, while they will be using some of these cyber security applications and cloud services will be using them not because they understand how it all works or have a great deal of knowledge, but likely because these applications are either necessary for security or because there is no other way to access and use some things without them. </p>

<p>Autonomous machines and AI in cyber security will have an affect of every one’s lives even if they are unaware. The direct effect will be making more secure online experience, even if it’s behind the scenes on a server half way across the world. The security on ones personal device will make it more simple for an everyday user to conduct their own threat detection and even if just a small amount provide a more secure space. </p>

<p>Everyone connected to the World Wide Web will be affected by the future of cyber security. Using any website or application online will mean that at some point myself and everyone I know will come across one or more of these cyber security applications through out their travel on the IOT. </p>
