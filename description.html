      <title2><b>Project Idea</b></title2>
      <br><br>

        <title2>Overall Aim</title2>  <p>
The overall aim for Team Visionsmiths, is to create a working mobile poker game that integrates augmented reality into the core gameplay experience. The ideal final product would include all features previously mentioned. A mobile app where users can play a game of poker with friends, random players, or AI of various difficulties. Using the camera on a smartphone, a player will be able to view their cards and other players using AR, while also being able to interact with them through text and voice chat. This is a very big and ambitious goal for Visionsmiths, thus smaller goals, organised in descending order, were made to assist in the process of creating this game.

  </p>


        <title2>Creating a plan</title2><p>
Using Figma, Team Visionsmiths has created a plan of how the game will look and function when loaded onto a smartphone. It will give an idea on how each screen and menu will look like, and how it flows as the user navigates through the application. It is important to plan out the aesthetics and functions of the game in advance, so all developers have a unified vision of the end-product, ensuring consistency among team members.

      </p>


        <title2>Fundamental poker game</title2><p>
  At its core, the application is a poker game and thus, the first aim towards developing the application itself, is to create a working poker game. The overall vision for the game is to implement augmented reality into the gameplay but developing the core game first is important. This creates an environment where AR features can be tested and working as intended in a context relevant to the end-product. If implementing AR ends in failure, it may also provide a foundation that could be used elsewhere with a different idea.  </p>


        <title2>Implement AR</title2>  <p>
Implementing augmented reality into the gameplay will be the next goal. The appeal of the game is in its AR capabilities. A regular poker game has already been seen and done before. It is important to develop the feature that separates the product from its competitors early on, as it gauges whether the product succeeds or fails. A successful AR poker game has marketable capabilities, but a regular poker game places it into an already saturated market.
</p>

      <p>
        <title2>Implementing opponents</title2>  <p>
As this is a game, it is important to be able to play against an opponent. The game will have two options for opponents. AI and against other players. AI will be developed before multiplayer due to the hurdles of multiplayer. It requires a constant internet connection and other people to enjoy the game. Developing an AI opponent first will allow for easier testing during the development phase, and the ability to enjoy the game regardless of circumstances.
  </p>


        <title2>Multiplayer</title2>  <p>
Providing multiplayer support will allow users to play with both friends and other random people across the globe. It isn’t the highest priority in terms of creating a functional game but is integral for mass appeal that will allow for enjoyment when disregarding the AR aspects of the game. In conjunction with AR, it provides further appeal to attract users to the app.
  </p>
  <title2>Monetisation</title2>  <p>
The core poker game play with AR capabilities and ability to play against other opponents encompasses all the required features to release the product to public. The next step is to monetise the game in some way. The game would be free to play and could be monetised with ads, an ad banner that’s removable with a one-time payment or through in app purchases. The overall goal for any product is to be profitable and implementing a monetisation method is an important part of achieving this.
</p>
<title2>Chat/voice chat</title2>  <p>
Text and voice chat is a non-integral feature, but would further enhance the user experience, by creating a more social environment. It is low on the priority list, as it doesn’t affect the fundamental game. It still functions the same and users will be able to play and experience AR. It is more quality of life over fundamental.
