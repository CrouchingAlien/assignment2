      <h1>  Group Reflection</h1>
      <p>We were able to quickly delegate tasks in the first meeting and those tasks were quickly and efficiently completed which enable us to work on more advanced parts of the project. The whole project went better than we could have anticipated. We had an extremely ambitious project idea and presentation idea despite our lack of qualifications. <br>
Other key factors that went well throughout include communication between members, understanding of the tasks required by each person and individuals doing things that needed to be done without delegation. <br>
The group worked well together especially because everyone got along, an environment where everyone is friendly but can still joke around is always good for getting work done. It never seemed like anyone felt left out or excluded and all group members were willing to take on tasks.</p>

<p>There is always possibility for improvements and I believe we could improve in some ways. Some of these key factors are, having an understanding of the development applications, use better hardware to run applications and maintaining the word document more effectively.</p>


<p>What was surprising is the fact some of us were able to work with Unity in developing AR assets and building to Android and create a user menu to work with the app despite not having any previous experience with Unity, Others were able to create a product design of the application in Figma which laid out a perfect design plan for our programmers and developers to follow and our art team to design.<br><br>
One other surprising aspect is how other members were actually able to use Unity to display assets using AR on their devices.<br>
Another key surprising moment was how fluidly the entire project came together as everyone was motivated and involved with their individual and group tasks.</p>

<p>Having this group work together over a couple of assessments now it makes it quite clear the amount of time, work and communication required when teams get together.<br> Fortunately this has become easier over the assessments and we can now work more effectively together without the need from outside motivation. Learning to work together effectively has been the most prominent learning point to take away from a group environment.</p>
