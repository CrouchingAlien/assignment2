<p>The group worked well together especially because everyone got along, an environment where everyone is friendly but can still joke around is always good for getting work done. It never seemed like anyone felt left out or excluded and all group members were willing to take on tasks. <br><br>
 The group only had a few small problems but the primary one would be that the group found it hard to agree upon meeting times mostly due to everyoneâ€™s personal life getting in the way making it hard to find times that suited everyone. Another slight issue was due to the course being online communication was low and some tasks would be completed multiple times by different members, but this was short lived because members started uploading to collaborative documents. <br><br>
 The most surprising thing was how much can be learnt by doing the practical side of things and just getting into a project.  I learned that when working in a group the flow of ideas comes quick especially when multiple people are collaborating on one idea, when a team member is stuck having another person with fresh ideas helps keep things flowing. </p>
