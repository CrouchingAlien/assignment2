      <title2><b>Project Idea</b></title2>
      <p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>The project Vision Smiths is proposing is a poker game that runs on mobile platforms and integrates augmented reality into the gameplay. Rather than playing on a two-dimensional board, users will be able to use their smartphone, where objects such as the poker table, cards and other players are seen on screen with AR.
<br><br>
 Players will no longer be bound to what is shown on screen and will be able to move and pan around, like how it would be played in real life.
As of this moment, this project is well out of the skill set of Vision Smiths. The outcome the team is expecting of this project, is to create a plan and mockup of the aesthetics and features of the app and work on displaying any game assets on screen using augmented reality. </p>


      <p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        This project is interesting because it provides an immersive experience of the old tabletop games for users across the world. The importance of giving users the ability to interact around the globe as if they were right in front of each other is great, especially when it is difficult to spend time with people face to face.
        <br><br>
        Augmented and virtual reality tabletop games fit in with current IT trends due to the massive overhaul that is happening in the IOT (Internet of things) now with the introduction of the meta verse. People are looking for ways to interact with others at a more personal level whilst still being at home more than ever before and that will only continue to increase.
        <br><br>
        Having the opportunity to work on a project like this would provide an employer with an accurate depiction of an individual's ability to complete a project as a team and work alone. It would also give an employer a clear understanding of where the individual's skill set aligns depending on which part of the application they have worked on.
        <br><br>

      <h3>Landscape</h3>
      <title2>Similar products and main competitors:</title2>
      <p/>
      Tilt Five (T5) is an AR tabletop game system in development that allows the user to play games on their own tabletops using holographic technology. They have lightweight glasses that attach to a PC or Android device, and it displays the game on your own table. It does require an actual physical game board and can be played locally or online.
      <br><br>
      Mirrorscape is working on putting a DND style game onto a tabletop using AR technology. They also want the ability for people to be able to watch streamers via AR putting the streamers game they are playing into your own home.
      <br><br>
      Ardent Roleplay is a mobile phone-based AR App that also focuses on DnD style gaming. They use digital cards, The App of course but also, they have implemented a creator kit for Dungeon Masters to create their own DnD adventures.
      <br><br>
<title2>Why is our project different from what is already available?</title2>
<p>Being that some of these products are not available yet as AR is still in its infancy our product differs a great deal.<br><br>
Mirrorscape and Ardent Roleplay both focus on DnD roleplay gaming other than a compendium of games with Ardent Roleplay out of those two being the closest to our project due to it being 100% mobile application oriented.
Tilt Five is closest based on it being a compendium of games. However, you require a physical game board and glasses as well as either a PC or Android device to make it work, which will increase the price quite a bit.<br><br>
Our product differs from all of these as it is more affordable and will work on IOS and Android devices.
It will utilise AR to completely generate whatever gameboard you want on whatever surface you wish viewed through your mobile device or tablet.
It will allow you to also see your opponent as an avatar sitting directly across from you and enables chat bubbles as well.
It being 100% mobile application also means the cost will be dramatically reduced starting at ZERO and paying for removal of ads and other games.</p>
