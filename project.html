      <title2><b>Project Idea</b></title2>
      <p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        Team Vision Smith’s project idea incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology with tabletop games in order to redefine
        and enhance the gameplay experience of how board games are played. Imagine having a digital library of a multitude of board games,
        all contained within a single play zone that changes depending on the game. Users would be able to interact directly with the
        augmented reality system to interact with the board or pieces to progress their game. It would also include a play store of sorts
        where users can purchase different board games or maybe even a subscription-based service that allows access to every game within the store.
        <br><br>
        As a first step towards this project, team Vision Smith’s is planning on first appealing to the mobile market.
        Users will be able to play poker in AR, through just the use of their smartphone device.
        The need for physical playing cards is removed, while maintaining a core game and social interactivity similar to that of real-life poker.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        This project is interesting because it provides an immersive experience of the old tabletop games for users across the world. The importance of giving users the ability to interact around the globe as if they were right in front of each other is great, especially when it is difficult to spend time with people face to face.
        <br><br>
        Augmented and virtual reality tabletop games fit in with current IT trends due to the massive overhaul that is happening in the IOT (Internet of things) now with the introduction of the meta verse. People are looking for ways to interact with others at a more personal level whilst still being at home more than ever before and that will only continue to increase.
        <br><br>
        Having the opportunity to work on a project like this would provide an employer with an accurate depiction of an individual's ability to complete a project as a team and work alone. It would also give an employer a clear understanding of where the individual's skill set aligns depending on which part of the application they have worked on.
        <br><br>

      <h3>Landscape</h3>
      <title2>Similar products and main competitors:</title2>
      <p/>
      Tilt Five (T5) is an AR tabletop game system in development that allows the user to play games on their own tabletops using holographic technology. They have lightweight glasses that attach to a PC or Android device, and it displays the game on your own table. It does require an actual physical game board and can be played locally or online.
      <br><br>
      Mirrorscape is working on putting a DND style game onto a tabletop using AR technology. They also want the ability for people to be able to watch streamers via AR putting the streamers game they are playing into your own home.
      <br><br>
      Ardent Roleplay is a mobile phone-based AR App that also focuses on DnD style gaming. They use digital cards, The App of course but also, they have implemented a creator kit for Dungeon Masters to create their own DnD adventures.
      <br><br>
<title2>Why is our project different from what is already available?</title2>
<p>Being that some of these products are not available yet as AR is still in its infancy our product differs a great deal.<br><br>
Mirrorscape and Ardent Roleplay both focus on DnD roleplay gaming other than a compendium of games with Ardent Roleplay out of those two being the closest to our project due to it being 100% mobile application oriented.
Tilt Five is closest based on it being a compendium of games. However, you require a physical game board and glasses as well as either a PC or Android device to make it work, which will increase the price quite a bit.<br><br>
Our product differs from all of these as it is more affordable and will work on IOS and Android devices.
It will utilise AR to completely generate whatever gameboard you want on whatever surface you wish viewed through your mobile device or tablet.
It will allow you to also see your opponent as an avatar sitting directly across from you and enables chat bubbles as well.
It being 100% mobile application also means the cost will be dramatically reduced starting at ZERO and paying for removal of ads and other games.</p>
