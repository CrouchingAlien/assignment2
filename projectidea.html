            <title2><b>Project Idea</b></title2>
            <p>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              Team Vision Smith’s project idea incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology with tabletop games in order to redefine
              and enhance the gameplay experience of how board games are played. Imagine having a digital library of a multitude of board games,
              all contained within a single play zone that changes depending on the game. Users would be able to interact directly with the
              augmented reality system to interact with the board or pieces to progress their game. It would also include a play store of sorts
              where users can purchase different board games or maybe even a subscription-based service that allows access to every game within the store.
              <br><br>
              As a first step towards this project, team Vision Smith’s is planning on first appealing to the mobile market.
              Users will be able to play poker in AR, through just the use of their smartphone device.
              The need for physical playing cards is removed, while maintaining a core game and social interactivity similar to that of real-life poker.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality technology within the video game industry is a rapidly growing market.
              Statista (2020) claims that the virtual reality annual global revenue from gaming in 2017 was roughly 400 million U.S. dollars.
              It grew to 800 million U.S. dollars in 2019 and is now forecasted to grow an additional 300% and reach 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in annual global revenue by 2024.
              <br><br>
              Although the cost on entry of AR and VR may be a deterrent to many, a large majority of people already have access to AR.
              As of January 2022, there are 6.648 billion smartphone users, which translates to 83.96% of the world’s population (Turner 2022).
              This means 6.6 billion people may already have access to AR technology.
              <br><br>
              An example of the potential of the AR market is the mobile game Pokémon Go, which implemented AR technology within their
              already popular franchise Pokémon. At its peak in 2016, Pokémon Go saw over 200 million users worldwide (Iqbal 2022) and
              to this day, still averages approximately 70 million users (ActivePlayer 2021)
              <br><br>
              With a growing market for augmented reality, there will also be a growing demand for a larger list of compatible video
              games and further innovation to the technology. The field is in its infancy and is ripe for opportunities to
              penetrate into the market.

            <p>
              <h3>Description</h3>
              This project would have the ability to contain multiple board games within one system. It could make use of one general board
              on a table, and the use of augmented reality (AR) glasses. Through the glasses, it would dynamically change the playing board,
              depending on the game and the users would be able to play and interact with the game through the projections. This would allow
              a multitude of board games to be played without the need of any set up or any physical objects the game would otherwise require.
              In conjunction with the ability to have a digital library of games available to the user, it can create a much more efficient
              experience space wise, compared to their physical counterparts. It would also allow for games to enhance the user experience.
              They can become more immersive, using the AR technology to animate the game. Now the background scenes can be painted, or
              animations that correspond to the user’s action can be shown. It has the ability to create a more intimate, personal game for the players.
              <br><br>
              To interact with the AR system, a controller, that could be similar to current VR controllers, would be used. The controller
              is tracked by the camera and in conjunction with physical button presses, it would be how the player rolls the dice, moves
              their pieces and in general, interact with the board. The board itself would use a physical board, that the AR system would use
              as a reference point to track and contain all assets the game would need.
              <br><br>
              Physical board games rely on the user’s imagination if they want to create a setting or play out a scene. An AR system could
              allow games to tie animations to specific moves or choices made in the game. For example, in a roleplaying game, defeating
              your opponent could play an animation relative to the method used to defeat them. In addition to this, it could be used to
              create a dynamic setting. Board games could use this to enhance the aesthetic of the board, or roleplaying games could project
              a background or scenes relating to the setting of the game. It creates a much more immersive experience for the players.
              <br><br>
              Another possible feature is the ability to save and resume the state of the game. Although this is also possible in a physical
              rendition of any game, this would eliminate the need for packing and setting up, as well as the requirement to physically memorise
              the state of the game. It is a more efficient, user-friendly approach where there is very little room for error.
              <br><br>
              A play store could be implemented to both facilitate the purchasing and organisation of a list of compatible games that the user owns.
              This allows individuals to easily browse through a multitude of games that they may find interesting as well as serve as a launcher
              for said games. A subscription service could also be launched with a high enough quantity of games available. The user would pay an
              annual fee and be granted access to every game in the library for no additional cost. Players would be able to try different games
              they may have been hesitant about, without committing the whole cost if they were to dislike it.
              <br><br>
              To expand into a mobile platform, the base device used would be a user’s smartphone. The game would utilise the video camera from
              the smartphone and display the game board and the user’s cards on screen using AR. In this game specifically, the game board displayed
              would be a poker table, and the player’s card would be displayed when the user holds their hand out in front of the camera.
              Players could pan and look around with their phone to see the board and potentially other players in real life if playing with friends
              or represented with an avatar if playing in an online setting. Move made by any player can be seen in real time through the AR system.
              These features allow the game to remove the hindrance of requiring physical playing cards, while maintaining the social aspect and
              feeling of playing the game in real life.
              <br><br>
              The game will feature a lobby system of potentially up to 8 people. Having a lobby allows users the opportunity to invite family and
              friends to play privately, or online publicly with potentially unranked and ranked lobbies. Unranked lobbies will cater to a more
              causal player, whereas having a ranked lobby with a rating system may satisfy more competitive players looking for a challenge.
              In addition, the player will have the option to add AI players of various difficulties. This would allow players to practice and
              play without internet connectivity.
              <br><br>
              Within the game, users are given the option to interact with other players through text and voice chat. This enables the
              possibility for social interaction within online lobbies. This will allow players to form friendships or even enemies through
              the games they play.
              <br><br>
              Although the main premise of the game is to integrate AR with tabletop games, it is also important to appeal to as many groups
              as possible. This means integrating an option to disable AR to play the game normally. This wouldn’t impact the core fundamental
              gameplay, but rather than playing poker within AR, it would be a regular 2D screen with a poker board. While AR may be an exciting
              innovating technology, it may not appeal to all demographics. Thus, implementing this option would allow for broader appeal and
              possibly higher player counts.
              <br><br>
              To monetise the game, it would be free to play with in app purchases and ads that are removable through a one time upgrade purchase.
              The alternative would be to release it as a paid app, however from 2019 to 2021, free apps in the Google and Apple Play Store averaged
              a market share of 96.2% (Ceci, L 2021). Microtransactions could be implemented for players to gain vanity items, such as custom skins
              for chips or cards. These items would add monetary gain while not affecting the core fundamental gameplay.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3>Tools and technology</h3>
              Firstly, this project idea requires a device that is compatible with augmented reality technology. It could make use of pre-existing
              AR devices, such as the Oculus Quest 2, the Merge AR/VR headset, Microsoft HoloLens 2, the Magic Leap One, or many more (SoftwareTestingHelp 2022).
              These devices may be limited by their components, tracking or user interface or there may be the chance of compatibility issues
              across the different devices. Due to this, a separate device may need to be designed if they are incompatible with the project.
              <br><br>
              To design and create the games, an engine compatible with VR and AR is required. The two most popular options, are Unreal Engine and Unity.
              The choice would be up to the developer. Unreal Engine offers much better graphical performance. It’s packed with tools and
              presets such as volumetric lighting, post-processing, and lens flare. This allows games created with Unreal Engine to look very
              realistic with very little tweaking. In contrast, Unity is more versatile and easier to integrate into VR and AR. It features
              a bigger tool-set with plugins that are very versatile and integrate into the extended reality infrastructure. It is also
              favoured with mobile and multiplatform applications, as it supports most development platforms at once (Zareba 2021).
              <br><br>
              Two approaches could be used to implement AR on a mobile platform. Marker-based applications, which use predefined markers as a
              reference to display the AR content, and location-based applications, which use GPS, accelerometer, or compass information to
              display the AR content on top of physical ones (Zhuravlov-Galchenko 2018). Both iOS and Android can be used for AR, as most augmented
              reality toolkits support these platforms. The 3D image recognition and tracking contained within these AR toolkits allow the apps to
              understand and enhance the spaces inside of the large space surrounding the user. To store all this data, cloud storage would be
              utilised over local storage, due to the vast amounts of data depending on how many markers are added to the application. The game
              would also need to support simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). SLAM is a specialised algorithm that tracks all the user’s
              movements. This allows the application to remember digital objects such as game pieces, and is able to assist with the positioning
              of these objects based on user input (Zhuravlov-Galchenko 2018).
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3>Skills required</h3>
              As stated by Sharma (2019) some of the skills required for development within AR and VR are knowledge of hardware specifications
              and how they operate, 3D modelling, computer-aided design(CAD), sound design and software engineering, just to name a few.
              <br><br>
              The developer needs to know how the AR devices work in conjunction with the relevant programming languages and skills in order to
              implement them into their engine of choice. If the developer chose Unity or Unreal Engine, then proficiency in C# or C++ respectively,
              would be required. Knowledge of 3D modelling, CAD and 3D animation would be required if the developer wished to create their own
              game assets. Sound design would also be useful for integrating audio into the game, which could be in the form of background music or effects.
              <br><br>
              In regards to the skills required in a mobile applications context, sufficient skills and knowledge in AR SDK is required. These may
              include Maxst, AR Toolkit, Apple ARKit or Vuforia. These create the fundamental infrastructure when developing an AR game. Strong
              programming skills in a mobile AR setting is also required. Majority of AR games used languages such as C#, C++, C, Java, Python
              or swift. As AR and VR can cause issues like motion sickness, some knowledge and command over user interface and user experience
              is required to minimise player discomfort.  For the graphic design aspect of mobile AR games, tools like Adobe Aero could be used
              in conjunction with Microsoft Visual Studio and OpenFrameworks to aid in the development process (OurCodeWorld 2019).
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              The goal for any game is to entertain the users playing it. If the project is successful, it will offer a unique way to enhance
              the gameplay experience of tabletop games. It creates an alternative way to enjoy board games and could open up more possibilities for the genre.
              <br><br>
              The underlying technology could also be used as a foundation for innovation. Future improvements to both the hardware and
              software could result in a much better user experience. It could also offer additional variables for developers to work with,
              which would create the opportunity for more unique and creative video games.
              <br><br>
              With the correct game, there is a large potential market for AR games. One example being the largely successful Pokémon Go.
              Small addictive games have the potential to generate substantial profits and create further hype. There’s a huge range of tabletop
              games for Android and iOS, but only very few AR games, thus there is a large repertoire for expanding the AR tabletop market.
