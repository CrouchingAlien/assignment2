      <title2>What are Robots?</title2>

      <p>Robots come in many different forms and varieties, often equipped with software such as A.I, or the ability to be remote controlled by a human. They are most often used to help with the complexity of human labour. These machines are currently being used and tested to help reduce the risk of human injury or fatality in workplaces such as, Engineering, Space Travel, Medical Operations, Military Operations and Mining. Robots are also being used in the entertainment industry, which can be seen in things such as, Kids Toys, Desk Buddies, Artificial Intelligence and even Video Games. 

Through the utilization of robots, society has been able to overcome a quantity of issues and tasks, that humans would not be able to accomplish on their own. An example of this comes in the form of the Mars rovers, currently being used to explore the surface of Mars which would otherwise be impossible for humans to accomplish so early with our technology. NASA has been using rovers for years, in an attempt to find any remains of previous or existing life, in addition to, possible chance for life to flourish on the planet. Another example comes from the medical industry, through the current use of machines to perform delicate operations that the human hands cannot accomplish with the same success rate on their own. More-so; Micro, and Nanorobotics are currently being created and tested to further help with advancement of medical engineering. 
</p>

<p>In the next few years, humans can expect to see more of the benefits of robotics, ranging from further advances in space exploration. For example, a robot made to explore subsurface voids on other planets has matured enough for scientists to be planning missions for the robots to go on. Continuum robots have recently been developed, these robots move with a more fluid, almost natural, motion. These robots will make be very helpful to the healthcare industry. From this development in medical engineering, a greater life expectancy will be noticed. A study has already been done to assess the benefit of robots being used in physical therapies for stroke patients. Due to the very positive results, we can expect this becoming normal for many medical practices soon. In manufacturing there will be less fatalities due to automation being involved in more hazardous tasks and further automation. Robotics removes a large margin of error in all of these fields, creating more opportunities for even greater expansion of Robotics in these areas of expertise. 
</p>

<p>Another area I expect to be impacted, somewhat dramatically, within the next decade is public transport. With Google working to perfect self-driving cars, already good enough for the use of the public, it would be a natural development to replace buses, trams, and trains. These will become entirely self-driven, reducing carbon emissions to the atmosphere and, becoming more energy efficient. Not to mention, lowering wait times and less chance of early or late transports. The job of a bus driver is often an unpleasant one. It is well known that they have suffered being underpaid, denied breaks, and often abused by passengers. Trains have already become automated, and this trend will only continue with the greater demand for public transport due to the rising numbers in our population. 

In response to everything becoming further digitized and the rise in online shopping. The technology for robotic deliveries, via drones, self-driving cars and possibly androids, will all become highly beneficial in the next few years. This will make online shopping even more convenient. Everything will be available to the public at the click of a button. 

</p>
</p>
<p>As robots are further improved and developed, we will see more efficiency in services and the manufacturing of products as well. As those services and/or manufacturing of products becomes easier to do we will see them becoming cheaper and more available to the public. There are many examples of this happening in our history. Previously, computers were only available to those who could afford it or big companies that needed it for their work. As we improved computers and found easier ways to make them, they became attainable for the public and now most people are expected to have some form of personal computer in their home. 

</p>
<p>The corporate world, scientific researchers, wealthy hospitals, and manufacturers will see the most impact from more advanced robots being developed in the near future. They are the only ones who really see this technology. This is because it’s not easy to mass produce new robots, nor is it cheap. But after some time, these developments will reach the average person’s home. We might see robots replacing some jobs but most of them will be ones that are far too tedious or dangerous for anyone to want to do. This is more of a solution, then a problem. When a robot is made for a job then a job is created to maintain and oversee that robot. This will take people out of harmful work environments, and the jobs created to oversee the robots will make up for the jobs lost. When new technology is developed old technology will always be retired. For robots it’s the cycle of their life. Although, there are efforts to increase the sustainability and upgrade or recycle old machinery instead of it going to waste.

As an avid user of a vast range of technologies and someone with a passion for the subject, I can expect my families and my own daily life to change drastically in the next ten years. When we no longer need to worry about going out to the store and spending hours travelling to different locations to get what we need on a weekly basis, we will have more time to spend on more important tasks. With automation of public transport, travelling via trains, trams or busses will become faster, safer, and more convenient. I’m hopeful that with physical therapies and advances in medical technologies I will have even more time with my friends and family without losing them to tragic events like, sickness and injury. Even my hobby of keeping pets will benefit as their medical engineering develops and we are able to learn more about their needs and health. I know there will be plenty of robotics used for monitoring and controlling temperatures in enclosures, feeding, water. I can even expect to have a live stream from any enclosures so I can monitor my pets and their wellbeing while I am away from home. Even the enclosures themselves could become self-cleaning robots within my lifetime. Not likely within my lifetime but in the lifetime of immediate family such as my own children or maybe my younger siblings, I can imagine a rising availability for space tourism and many world changing discoveries to be made from the developments of robots in space exploration. In the ongoing search for a way to mine and use resources from other planets, we will see less taken from our own planet and possibly cheaper prices of products and fuels with new abundances of said resources.
