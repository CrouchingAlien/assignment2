I have been into IT since my family first got an Amiga 500 and since then I have been gaming and building computers all my life.
I am studying IT to go on to my bachelor's degree in IT and move on to start my own software application business.</p>

                My name is Jarrod Nguyen. I’m currently studying IT at RMIT University, student number S3934886.
                I’m Vietnamese by ethnicity but was born and raised in Melbourne Australia.
                I’ve loved gaming all my life, which is what sparked my interest in IT, but despite this, the
                only IT experience I have are a few previous programming courses.
                Another interest I’ve recently picked up is coffee.
                Both the brewing of, and latte art aspects.

            <article class=" info"><title2> Student Number: S3934468  </title2>
              <p>I’m Jess! I was born in Christchurch, New Zealand. I travelled a lot through my childhood. I lived for years
                at a time in places such as the USA, England, and Australia. Due to all the travelling I did,
                I really fell in love with many languages and cultures. My passion for IT is to eventually have the tools and abilities
                to turn my ideas into reality. I’d love to code software that makes a meaningful impact on many people and ideally,
                I’d make a living from my creations. I’m self-taught in HTML and CSS with some familiarity with JavaScript and Python.
                I hobby build my own PC’s and love playing video games on it. We thought of the name Visions Smiths
                because it reflects how in our AR project, we will be building an app that allows you to see what you
                are virtually interacting with in the space you are in.</p>

<title2> Student Number: S3930698 </title2>
              <p>I have recently discharged from the military after 6 years and am interested in pursuing a career in information technology. I enjoy fitness and challenging myself to try new things. In my spare time I watch anime, play golf, play online games, if I’m not doing either of those id likely be with friends or taking a mean nap. Currently I have very minimal background experience in IT, This website being the first group project I have been a part of and the second website I have been involved in putting together on github. I’m interested in blockchain development and I have recently learned I am also quite interested in the cyber security space.</p>

<title2> How well did we work together in A2? </title2>
<p>The group overall worked well together in assignment 2 and everyone contributed to the assignment and completed their delegated tasks. There was no conflict between members at any time which made working together and getting tasks done easy with no timewasting or disagreeing. Organization was lacking at the beginning as we were a week late starting our first meeting, but the group managed to achieve their goals and handed in a quality result. Because no one in the group knew anything about anyone when they first had come together it was clear that a solid structure for the team would be lacking.
</p>

<title2>Will we make any changes for A3? </title2>
<p>Changes to the group in assignment 3 will be minimal as our group seemed to all get along and everyone contributed to the work. One big change that will develop through assignment 3 will be an improvement in structure with a more defined set of roles with some members taking on leadership and organizational rolls. When working as a team having a better structure really helps with better workflow and quality.
