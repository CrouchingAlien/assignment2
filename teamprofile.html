            <div class="hide"><title2> Student Number: S3934012 </title2>
              <p>My name is Derek Geerin, currently studying IT and programming at RMIT university. 
                I am married to a Filipina, and I have 3 kids, all boys, 1 with my wife who is now four months old,
                1 with an ex who is 10 years old and my wife's son, my stepson who is 9 years old.  
I have been into IT since my family first got an Amiga 500 and since then I have been gaming and building computers all my life. 
I am studying IT to go on to my bachelor's degree in IT and move on to start my own software application business.</p>

              <p>
                My name is Jarrod Nguyen. I’m currently studying IT at RMIT University, student number S3934886.
                I’m Vietnamese by ethnicity but was born and raised in Melbourne Australia.
                I’ve loved gaming all my life, which is what sparked my interest in IT, but despite this, the
                only IT experience I have are a few previous programming courses.
                Another interest I’ve recently picked up is coffee.
                Both the brewing of, and latte art aspects.

            <div class="hide"><title2> Student Number: S3934468  </title2>
              <p>I’m Jess! I was born in Christchurch, New Zealand. I travelled a lot through my childhood. I lived for years
                at a time in places such as the USA, England, and Australia. Due to all the travelling I did,
                I really fell in love with many languages and cultures. My passion for IT is to eventually have the tools and abilities
                to turn my ideas into reality. I’d love to code software that makes a meaningful impact on many people and ideally,
                I’d make a living from my creations. I’m self-taught in HTML and CSS with some familiarity with JavaScript and Python.
                I hobby build my own PC’s and love playing video games on it. We thought of the name Visions Smiths 
                because it reflects how in our AR project, we will be building an app that allows you to see what you
                are virtually interacting with in the space you are in.</p>

            How the test results can be helpful
          </h3>
          <p>
            Using the results from the test each person in the group gives us an opportunity to better understand the characteristics and traits of other group members in a way that would be hard through conventional dialog. Using the results of the tests will help each team member get an idea of how the group may structure itself.

          <h3>
            What the team might lack
          </h3>
          <p>
            Using the information from everyone's results we can get a good look at how the group may form and what strengths and weaknesses it will have. The results of the tests clearly show a lack of creativity. A lack of creativity in the group might result in less ideas that lack content. Most of the group members are logical thinkers that do not consider emotions. Not considering emotions especially of others when making decisions can easily cause conflict within a group. Looking at the results from everyone’s learning style tests show the group lacks in the auditory learning style.  Because the group is made up of mostly hands on tactical learners and visual learners it might limit the groups’ ability to conduct research in the form of auditory learning.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Possible Strengths
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is clear the main strength of the team is its logical and rational thinking. Being logical and rational allows for ease of problem solving and reasonable solutions to difficult problems. The group has many hands-on learners. Having lots of hands-on learners means the group should have no trouble getting through the practical parts of assignments. The group is made up of friendly and agreeable people making it easy for everyone to get along.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Summary
          </h3>
          <p>
            The group will work well together because everyone seems to be similar and yet diverse in multiple ways giving the team a good mix of both common ground and unique abilities. The team has some weaknesses but with our knowledge of said weaknesses and our open communication with one another, nothing will stop the group from completing the assigned tasks.
