<title2><b>Testing </b></title2>
<p>As development progresses into a working application, we will distribute it first amongst ourselves testing it out on both Android and IOS platforms, as we test it, we will write down any bugs we find and set about patching those bugs and fixing other errors that might come up.
We will then let our family members download it to test it out for server stability and testing.<br><br>
Once we are satisfied it has been scrutinized thoroughly, we will release it to the public on both IOS and Andoid app store while continuing to make new items available such as skins for your avatar and skin designs for cards and tables as well as other patches to fix and address any issues as they arise.<br><br>
Testing the application will be done in multiple phases. During the development phase, the application will constantly be tested and debugged, fixing the big, obvious issues and bugs that may arise. The next
phase can begin when the core gameplay, AR capabilities and AI opponents are all implemented. The game would be given to family and friends to test the game. A larger number of people would allow for any issues missed during development to be identified and fixed before the public sees the game. <br><br>
As public perception can greatly affect the reputation of a game, it is important to polish it to the best of the teams’ ability before transitioning into the beta testing phase. Users of all backgrounds will be chosen from an application process. This allows the team to gain feedback from both casual users and technophiles to facilitate features and changes that is intuitive and caters to all parties. As stated by Joel Spolsky (Fix referencing) , approximately only one in five people will send feedback on the application and ideally, a team should aim for 100 serious testers for every team member that’s available to handle feedback. This would result in aiming for 1500 users for a beta test to get 300 serious responses and feedback. Hopefully, this would result in the discovery and patching of the more niche issues and bugs and creation of a more polished product.
