        <b>Contribution</b><br>
        Throughout the weeks we spent putting together assignment 2 we all played major roles and completed tasks that we organised for each other.
        Each one of us put forth ideas and voted on a group name, wrote an individual personal introduction, Industry data, Ideal jobs, and Group
        reflection report, and expanded on ideas and information for our Project Idea section. Jarrod specifically, expanded the overview, motivation,
        and description for the Augmented Reality project idea. Derek, wrote the Tools, skills required and outcome for the team’s project Idea.
        For the IT Technology section, four of us chose a topic to research and report on. Derek wrote a report on Cloud Technology, servers and its services.
        Kolby wrote his report on Block-chain and cryptocurrency. Cameron researched and wrote about Cybersecurity. Jessica reported on robots.
        For the website, we all had an input and edited parts of it though, Cameron was the lead on setting it up. While the four of us wrote our reports on
         IT technologies, Jarrod analysed the Burning Glass data and wrote a report on our Ideal Jobs, compiling the skills we all needed. For our interview
         with our IT professional, we all gave ideas on who to contact and Jessica wrote to a few of them and organised a representative of Euclideon Holographics
         to speak to us. For this interview Derek prepared the questions we would be asking and organised the order in which we would speak.
         Afterwards, Jarrod transcribed the recording of the interview and appropriately presented it within our Assignment. Meanwhile, Kolby had also
         been summarising and comparing our group test results for our personal team profile. During our time together all of us contributed to coordinating the tasks and meetings on MS Teams.
        We have all agreed that the GitHub activity log shows who made an edit and when they edit was made. Though it isn’t a direct reflection of the overall
        contribution of each of our members as a lot of the work was done outside of Github first when we found the report coming to completion, we added it all
        to GitHub. This way we could spend our time focused on learning GitHub and add the finished content with a simple copy-paste.

        <b>GitHub Audit Trail Reflection</b><br>
        While the GitHub audit trail may accurately reflect how sections were delegated, it does not accurately depict the amount of time and effort
        put in by each team member. Nor does it show member’s contribution if responsibilities of a section were split. It is hard to gain a grasp on
        the actual contributions based just off the editing and commits on the audit trail. It is weighted to show that higher number of commits, and
        edits reflects a higher amount of contribution to the overall assignment, which may include various amounts of very small edits. The difficulty
        and effort required to complete a section is not reflected at all through the audit trail.
